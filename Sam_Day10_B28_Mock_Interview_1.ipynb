We use single,double & tripple quotes to represent a string.\\n\\n2. What is the use of f string?\\n> f string stand for format string. It is used to reference the string in a custom format. We use f\"  for f string.\\n\\n3. What is a list?\\n> A list is a collection of objects in an order. We use [] for list.\\n\\n4. What is the syntac for a for loop?\\n> for x in list:\\n\\tindendation\\tprint(x)\\n\\n5. What is the difference between sort and sorted?\\n> Sort sorts data in the list permanently, where as sorted will temporarirly sort data.\\n\\tstudent = [\\'a\\',\\'b\\',\\'c\\']\\n\\tprint(sorted(student))\\n\\tstudent.sort()\\n\\tprint(student)\\n\\n6. What is a tuple datatype?\\n> A tuple is an immutable list. We use () for tuple. We generally use it to store data that cannot be edited like password.\\n\\n7. Explain the concept of conditional statements?\\n> A conditional statement is used to define the action the code needs to take when a specific scenario/condition is met. We have if,if else & elif conditional statements in Python.\\n\\n8.  name = \\'shafi m\\'\\n\\tWhat is the string method that can be used to to show the name in proper format?\\n   > We need to use name.title() to have the name outputed in proper format.\\n \\n9. students = [\\'a\\',\\'b\\',\\'c\\',\\'d\\',\\'e\\']\\n   What is the method to get the total count of this list?\\n  >len(students) is the function to print the total count of students list.\\n  \\n10. student \\'f\\' I need added to the students list. How do I do that?\\n> We can use append to add \\'f\\' student to the students list. This will add \\'e\\' to the end of the list. To add \\'f\\' in a specific possition, we need to use insert.\\n  students.append[\\'f\\'] -- Will make the list as: [\\'a\\',\\'b\\',\\'c\\',\\'d\\',\\'e\\',\\'f\\']\\n  students.insert(3,\\'f\\'] -- [\\'a\\',\\'b\\',\\'c\\',\\'f\\',\\'d\\',\\'e\\']\\n\\n11. What is difference between tuple & list?\\n> A tuple is an immutable list. A tuple is refered by () whereas a list is refered by []\\n  students = [\\'a\\',\\'b\\']  -- This is a list\\n  student_ids = (1,2)   -- This is a tuple.\\n  \\n12. What is dictionaries?\\n> A dictionaries is a mutable key:value order datatype in Python. We use {} to refer the dictionaries. The value inside a dictionary can be edited but not the key.\\n  employee = {\\'id\\':675433,\\'name\\':\\'sam\\',\\'batch\\':\\'B28\\'}\\n  Here, employee is the of dictionary datatype.\\n  id,name,batch - Are the keys.\\n  675433, sam, B28 - Are the values for the above keys respectively.\\n  A value can never be empty or null.\\n\\n\\n'"
